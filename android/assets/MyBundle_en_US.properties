  Elizabeth raises the letter from the floor and begins to read it with her frail but calm voice.\n\n\

  The guard continues his journey and I start packing my equipment.\nThe next day I say goodbye to my family and begin the journey to war.

story2 = The war is at its worst, but I can't think of anything other than my family.\n\n\
    I hear the Commander shouting "FORWARDS!"\n\
    I raise my sword and charge towards the enemy with my brothers alongside me.\n\n\
    Days seem to crawl forward, and every day I am grateful for being alive.\n\n\
    However, one day the commander comes with a letter and tells us the joyful news, for us the war is over.

story3 =  I see my house’s front door, it's getting closer by the moment. I can’t wait to surprise my family. \
  The wait through all slow days was worth it, I finally get home.\n\n\
   I step inside the house, it’s quiet. I hear cautious steps upstairs.\n\n\
  I start walking up the stairs step by step. I notice my steps are getting more cautious as I approach upstairs. \
  At the top of the stairs I shout for Elizabeth, then Carol, and finally Arthur.\n\nThere is no answer.

story4 = As I walk up the last step of the staircase, I am attacked by a mysterious character. The character falls down the stairs with me.\n\n\
  The character is wearing a long black robe and is trying to hide its face. \
  I try to get the hood off but the character is up before me and runs out of the house.\n\nI start running after the character.

story5 = After a short run I close the gap but he doesn't give up easily. The character tries to hit me, but I get him to the ground.\n\n\
   "STOP IMMEDIATELY!", The guard shouts. I do not respond to the guard, because at the moment my only goal is to see the face of this stranger. \
  I feel a hard blow in my back.\n\n\n\nMy head hurts... I... I don't remember anything after that.
